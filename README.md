# Banana Price Prediction Using Long Short-Term Memory Model using MongoDB as the Big data storage and Processing Technology

### Executive Summary

**Project Title:** Banana Price Prediction Using Long Short-Term Memory Model with MongoDB as the Big Data Storage and Processing Technology

#### Overview

The "Banana Price Prediction" project aims to leverage advanced machine learning techniques, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, to forecast banana prices accurately. This predictive model will be supported by MongoDB, a robust NoSQL database, serving as the primary technology for big data storage and processing. The project addresses the critical need for accurate price forecasting in the agricultural sector, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions, optimize supply chains, and enhance market strategies.

#### Objectives

1. **Develop an Accurate Predictive Model:** Utilize LSTM to create a model capable of predicting banana prices with high precision based on historical data and other relevant factors.
2. **Leverage Big Data:** Implement MongoDB to efficiently store, manage, and process vast amounts of historical price data, weather information, and market trends.

#### Methodology

1. **Data Collection and Storage:** Collect historical banana price data, weather data, and other relevant market information. Use MongoDB to store this data, taking advantage of its flexibility and scalability.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the collected data to ensure it is suitable for training the LSTM model. This involves handling missing values, normalizing data, and feature engineering.
3. **Model Development:** Develop the LSTM model using Python and relevant machine learning libraries. Train the model on the preprocessed data and fine-tune hyperparameters to optimize performance.
4. **Integration with MongoDB:** Implement data pipelines to feed data from MongoDB into the LSTM model for both training and prediction phases. Use MongoDB's aggregation framework for efficient data retrieval and processing.
5. **Evaluation and Validation:** Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Validate the model with a separate test dataset to ensure its generalizability.

#### Expected Outcomes

1. **Accurate Price Predictions:** Achieve a high level of accuracy in banana price predictions, aiding stakeholders in making informed decisions.
2. **Optimized Supply Chains:** Enable better planning and inventory management for suppliers and retailers, reducing waste and enhancing profitability.
3. **Scalable Solution:** Develop a scalable big data solution using MongoDB that can handle large volumes of data and provide real-time analytics.
4. **Enhanced Market Strategies:** Provide actionable insights to farmers and distributors, helping them adapt to market changes swiftly and effectively.

#### Conclusion

The "Banana Price Prediction" project integrates cutting-edge machine learning techniques with powerful big data technologies to address the complexities of agricultural price forecasting. By harnessing the capabilities of LSTM models and MongoDB, this project aims to deliver a robust, scalable, and accurate predictive system that supports the agricultural industry in making data-driven decisions and optimizing their operations.
